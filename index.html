<p><a href="linemarginchart.html">Time Series analysis</a><br/>A time series analysis of the Network traffic is interactively shown here. A plot of graph of number of requests received with the advance of time is shown. Chart can be used to analyze the results like when exactly there is a load on the system receiving number of requests or when it is idle. Here the time span can be adjusted manually as per the duration user wants to see.</p>

<p><a href="stackedbarchart.html">Stacked Bar Chart</a><br/>A Bar chart showing the number of requests sent from each port of the source IP address. The main advantage of the graph is to be able to analyze the port wise traffic where exactly there is load and also IP wise traffic. Hence on interactive basis the graph can use both source IP as well as corresponding ports data to analyze the flow.</p>

<p><a href="collberative.html">Interactive Bar chart with Pie Chart</a><br/>An advancement to the above Stacked bar chart where we had no manual viewing of data. Here in this chart user can see the traffic related to particluar IP, also related to aprticular port in total or related to specific IP along with the distribution of the requests in percentage in Pie chart. User can manually select the area he needs to explore.</p>

<p><a href="monthlydata.html">Monthly Pie Chart</a><br/>Monthly Pie chart shown the distribution of requests per source IP in an Pie chart for a month at a time. User can manually change the month of which he wishes to see the monthly distribution of requests.</p>
